# Hosted Web Phase 1 navigation record

Phase 1 is complete. This directory retains the PR #252 routing paths because they are the established
navigation boundary for base-sync control; it does not reopen a Phase 1 product node.

Current packet authority is `pr252-latest-base-sync-router-v2-proposal`. The Phase 2 product wave at
`eee2389f7ee9300df93ef02d92e9ae114949aff4` is accepted and integrated. Only latest-base sync blocks
the Phase 2 milestone and the next phase. The canonical PR head and product materialization
source are the live PR #252 head, resolved once per attempt at prepare/start (authoring-time
head: `ec43eb727b5a90dbbd16bdd74b72397000abcd82`); the accepted product-wave commit is its
historical ancestor.

## Supersession

The current route supersedes:

- every packet-authored or branch-authored PR #252 base/source pin;
- every old same-job continuation, dirty-worktree reuse, or fixed conflict-path contract;
- the earlier Phase 2 candidate/product-blocked language as current launch authority; and
- every route that needed a new docs revision merely because the live PR base moved.

No currently observed base SHA is recorded as durable authority. The accepted Phase 2 product SHA is
historical provenance, the active router/canonical head is stable source authority, and the base is
per-attempt runtime authority.

## Current route

Read the detailed [controller packet](controller-packet.md), [execution DAG](execution-dag.md), and
[latest-base conflict lane](lanes/pr252-base-conflict-resolution.md).

At atomic prepare/start, `ProjectScopedControl` resolves the live PR #252 base exactly once and
records it as a full 40-hex `resolvedBaseSha` in
`pr252.latest-base-binding/v1`. In the same transition it resolves the live PR head once, and the runtime materializes the
product attempt from that resolved head, records the actual conflict paths, and binds the
resolved head and base as the ordered first and second parents. Symbolic names, abbreviated
SHAs, observed prior bases, and re-resolution within an attempt are forbidden.

One product producer may resolve only those actual conflicts. It preserves both parent behaviors,
runs all focused and mechanical checks, self-reviews, and returns `HOLD`. The controller directly
reruns mechanical gates. One fresh independent integration/architecture/security semantic reviewer
then returns `ACCEPT` or `REJECT`; there is no separate mechanical reviewer.

On `ACCEPT` with P0/P1/P2 `0/0/0`, the broker alone may build the exact reviewed tree as a true
merge ordered
`[attempt.canonicalHeadSha, resolvedBaseSha]`, promote and push it with the attempt-bound
canonical head as the expected old PR head, and prove GitHub sees the exact head/base pair as
non-conflicting. A later base mismatch invalidates only the attempt and never this stable packet.

## Control boundary

Git commit SHA is primary provenance. Do not add repository handoff manifests or hash-of-manifest
bookkeeping. The runtime owns execution primitives only; the controller owns the entire DAG and every
authorization decision.

No real project, team launch/provisioning, product terminal/smoke, provider/auth, raw lifecycle,
other-repository, broad-docs, or Fast activity is authorized. This router launches no worker or
successor and ends `HOLD`.
