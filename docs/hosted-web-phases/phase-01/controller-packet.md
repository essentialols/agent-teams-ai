# Phase 1 controller plan: single-source contracts and conformance

## Status and authority

- Status: current execution authority only for one future serial `P1.S1` schema-version remediation
- Worker-start packet revision: `phase-01-s1-schema-version-remediation-r1`
- Remediation base: integrated P1.S1 commit `da9625e78c0c96699162793a7ebba0657140d937`
- Transition base: `f12a85af0fddadd06f69a27ef408d26bc27eb3fc`
- Accepted P1.S0 commit: `6f1a87daa9a4bfdf5d754347d92f313f28d0f95d`
- Historical P1.S0 phase start SHA: `5f30df49e052d1cc1d0e7efd03aa105673b5b614`
- Preserved proposal planning base: `3bc0dfa7c00261785c0c752270cb302a9294e751`
- Phase 0 accepted freeze commit: `f4fa24aac9615a4ce10632965a2244a2e11a273e`
- Remediation start SHA: the isolated worker `workspaceRoot` Git HEAD bound as `phaseStartSha`; it
  must contain the integrated docs-only remediation router packet, descend from the remediation base,
  and leave non-router paths unchanged from that base
- Required decisions: ADR-15, ADR-19, ADR-20, plus the eventual frozen Phase 0 register
- Explicit authorization: revision/schema-version remediation for rejected `P1.NEG.SCHEMA_VERSION`,
  owner `P1.1A-schema-version-remediation`, only
- Authorized producer target: **one future serial remediation worker after packet integration**
- Later-subphase producer target: **zero**

S0 froze the downstream identifiers, paths, ownership, commands, and pairings. Integrated P1.S1
commit `da9625e78c0c96699162793a7ebba0657140d937` preserves the useful kernel implementation. The
authoritative operator-provided independent integration review finding is quoted verbatim:

> "Independent integration review formally REJECTED P1.S1 commit da9625e78 only for incomplete
> P1.NEG.SCHEMA_VERSION."

This finding is the independent-review provenance for the only current producer authority. The
remediation packet explicitly supersedes `phase-01-s1-foundations-r1` as worker-start authority while
preserving the integrated commit, its handoff, and accepted S0 evidence. This controller cannot render
or admit an S2-or-later worker.

The exact worker-start identity is `projectId: agent-teams-hosted-web-refactor`,
`controllerJobId: phase-01-p1-s1-schema-version-remediation-controller-r1`, `phaseId: phase-01`,
`laneId: p1-s1-schema-version-remediation`, controller
`docs/hosted-web-phases/phase-01/controller-packet.md`, lane
`docs/hosted-web-phases/phase-01/lanes/p1-s1-schema-version-remediation.md`, revision
`phase-01-s1-schema-version-remediation-r1`, and base
`da9625e78c0c96699162793a7ebba0657140d937`. Every cross-product with the superseded foundations
packet, Phase 0, accepted S0 history, a second remediation job, or a later Phase 1 subphase fails
closed.

The accepted `P0.D.TARGET_IMAGE` narrowing in the planning base closes that single Phase 0 gate for
the Phase 0-to-Phase 1 transition. It does not admit an image or composition: Phase 5 retains the exact
image/profile, provider canaries, complete inventory, terminal-negative scan, and standalone
production-composition gate. The accepted freeze removes this item from Phase 0 transition blockers.
Exact-image/profile proof, provider canaries, production composition, and terminal-negative admission
remain fail-closed implementation risks owned by later phases.

## Accepted P1.S0 evidence

P1.S0 is accepted at `6f1a87daa9a4bfdf5d754347d92f313f28d0f95d`, which is an ancestor of
the transition base. The exact six paths under `docs/research/hosted-web/phase-1/bootstrap/` are
immutable accepted input and remain unchanged at the transition base. Their recorded historical
`phaseStartSha` remains `5f30df49e052d1cc1d0e7efd03aa105673b5b614`; it is not replaced by the
acceptance commit, transition base, router-transition commit, or an S1 worker SHA.

## P1.S1 remediation authorization boundary

The one future worker may change only the revision/schema-version implementation, focused tests,
fixtures, and handoff paths listed exactly in
[`lanes/p1-s1-schema-version-remediation.md`](./lanes/p1-s1-schema-version-remediation.md). It must
validate known response fields before discarding additive response fields and must reject disallowed
unknown input-object fields with `phase1-schema-version-invalid-or-unsupported`. It may not change any
other integrated kernel work or create route/catalog conventions (`P1.1B`), conformance or ratchets
(`P1.1C`), the team-lifecycle feature (`P1.1D`), review/integration evidence, production transport
registration, or a filesystem-backed adapter. A worker-start contract that binds any other Phase 1
lane conflicts with this controller and must be rejected.

## Remediation ready gate, ownership, and capacity

Before the single admission, the controller must prove all of the following:

1. The exact docs-only router packet commit is integrated after `da9625e78`, and the runtime binds it
   as both `planBundleCommit` and `phaseStartSha`; no product remediation occurred before integration.
2. The non-router tree at `phaseStartSha` matches `da9625e78`, including all accepted S0 evidence and
   useful integrated P1.S1 work.
3. The runtime contract binds the exact identity, bounded reads, five owned implementation/test/
   fixture paths, handoff path, and commands in the remediation lane packet.
4. No producer is active or has already consumed this packet revision, and the `P1.S2` producer count
   is zero.

The lane registry contains exactly one current row:

| Lane                               | Packet                                      | Dependency  | Evidence IDs                                         | Capacity |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `p1-s1-schema-version-remediation` | `lanes/p1-s1-schema-version-remediation.md` | `da9625e78` | `P1.1A.VERSION.REMEDIATION`, `P1.NEG.SCHEMA_VERSION` | one-shot |

Only that lane owns the exact writable paths in its packet. Every other source, test, fixture,
handoff, docs, research, evidence, configuration, and orchestration path is read-only. A blocked,
failed, or rejected result closes the one capacity slot: there is no retry loop, refill, salvage into
a broader worktree, or automatic successor.

## Outcome

Prove one small shared contract kernel and one read-only team-lifecycle query whose direct,
IPC-shaped, and HTTP-shaped test adapters call the same application use case and produce semantically
equivalent outcomes. Both transport-shaped adapters live under the test tree, are assembled only by
the conformance harness, and are rejected by production import/mount checks. Establish separate
feature-owned route/capability sources and enforceable
architecture/parity ratchets without creating an ElectronAPI clone, route framework, mega DTO, or
second lifecycle authority.

## Goals

- Freeze minimal conventions for opaque IDs, query context, revisions/cursors, safe errors, schemas,
  parsing, and version behavior.
- Create only the contracts needed by `ListTeamLifecycleSummaries` and its descriptors.
- Prove transport-neutral application semantics through three isolated test adapters.
- Cross-reference route, capability, auth policy, handler, client, schema, IPC, parity, and tests by
  stable proposed IDs while keeping their sources separate.
- Turn direct Electron/global transport use, hidden unsupported controls, forbidden imports, stale
  ledger signatures, and route/client/policy drift into failing tests.
- Leave a reviewed, reversible seam that Phase 2 can bind to canonical identity and production reads.

## Non-goals

- No Phase 2 identity substrate, canonical legacy adoption, filesystem-backed lifecycle repository,
  renderer cutover, hosted team list rollout, or state migration.
- No mutations, events publication, runtime launch/control, auth implementation, proxy/CORS changes,
  production hosted composition, Docker artifact, terminal, SSE, or WebSocket work.
- No production IPC channel, preload/global facet, or HTTP route. The IPC-shaped and Fastify adapters
  exist only in the isolated conformance test tree until canonical identity, a real authorized reader,
  and authenticated hosted composition exist.
- No change to existing `TeamsAPI.list`, `team:list`, `GET /api/teams`, `teamSlice`, or browser stub
  behavior except an integration-owned ratchet/quarantine annotation if bootstrap proves it necessary.
- No broad extraction from `src/main/ipc/teams.ts`, `src/main/http/teams.ts`, `TeamDataService`, or
  `teamSlice`; no all-parity schema/client generation.
- No generic DI container, service locator, transport framework, universal repository, or capability
  boolean per legacy method.

## Practical clean boundary

The new use case owns pagination, immutable projections, revision/cursor rules, and application
outcomes. Its consumer-owned port returns normalized legacy-safe records from an in-memory fixture in
Phase 1. Test-only input adapters own fake principal binding, wire parsing, and transport mapping. They
do not own filtering, errors, or pagination. Phase 2 may add production IPC/HTTP registration and
legacy/filesystem output adapters after stable identity exists without changing application semantics.

The new proof does not claim that a name is a `TeamId`. Fixture `TeamId` values are explicitly
synthetic and test-only. Production identity generation, persistence, and legacy mapping remain
blocked on Phase 2.

## Proposed subphases

| Subphase                       | Result                                                                                 | Admission                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `P1.S0` serial bootstrap       | Freeze exact IDs, files, owners, fixtures, baseline fingerprints, and packet revision. | Accepted at `6f1a87da`.                                                  |
| `P1.S1` foundations            | `P1.1A` minimal shared contract kernel and focused contract tests.                     | Integrated at `da9625e78`; review rejected only `P1.NEG.SCHEMA_VERSION`. |
| `P1.S1` schema remediation     | Known-field-first response parsing, additive response discard, strict input fields.    | One future serial node after this packet is integrated.                  |
| `P1.S2` parallel production    | `P1.1B` route assertions and `P1.1C` conformance/ratchets on disjoint paths.           | Blocked until reviewed S1 integration.                                   |
| `P1.S3` seam review            | R1 falsifies 1B/1C architecture, omission sensitivity, and production isolation.       | Both 1B and 1C complete.                                                 |
| `P1.S4` first proof and review | Team-lifecycle list query plus isolated test adapters, then R2 semantic review.        | R1 accepted before 1D; 1D complete before R2.                            |
| `P1.S5` serialized integration | Shared ratchet/evidence wiring, full gate, rollback proof, evidence freeze.            | R2 accepted; one integration owner.                                      |

The detailed DAG and proposed ownership are in [execution-dag.md](./execution-dag.md).

## Controller invariants

1. Preserve the accepted S0 commit, exact evidence paths, and historical `phaseStartSha`; never rerun
   or rewrite S0 during an S1 transition or worker start.
2. The remediation child starts from one `phaseStartSha` containing this docs-only packet and the
   accepted serial bootstrap evidence; no product remediation may precede packet integration.
3. A path has one live writer. Production registration files are read-only throughout Phase 1; any
   other existing shared ratchet/evidence file has only the integration owner.
4. A frozen ID has one evidence owner; reviewers may falsify it but not publish a competing row.
5. This one-shot lane is never retried or refilled. Any further attempt requires a separately reviewed
   packet revision and new controller decision.
6. Test-only IPC and HTTP adapter/composition modules must be impossible to import or mount from any
   production composition, preload, renderer API, IPC registry, or HTTP registry.
7. Negative fixtures are acceptance evidence; weakening them requires packet revision and review.
8. No real user project, provider credential, host path, or raw auth/runtime payload enters fixtures or
   handoffs.

## Monitoring and stop conditions

Check useful progress at least every ten minutes while the one job exists. Stop it on a stale base,
revision, plan bundle, or phase start; a missing or altered review quote; pre-integration product
remediation; prior packet consumption; write overlap; unknown evidence ID; source/packet mismatch;
dependency, docs, research, orchestration, or non-owned change; failure to produce the exact
schema-version diagnostic or semantics; raw path or secret evidence; production exposure; or an
unclassified owned-path baseline failure. Return the blocker record defined by `PACKET_STANDARD.md`.
There is no unrelated current lane and no automatic retry.

## Remediation integration gate

Independent review must prove all seven acceptance items and all checks in the remediation lane
packet. In particular, a same-version response is accepted only after known fields validate and its
returned projection discards additive fields; a disallowed unknown input-object field fails with
`phase1-schema-version-invalid-or-unsupported`. The review must reconcile the exact changed-path set,
patch-manifest hash, per-file hashes, base/start/result SHAs, original review provenance, and explicit
packet supersession. Any missing negative control, non-owned change, vague result, or absent command
and exit code rejects the candidate and closes this one-shot node.

## Definition of Done and successor-controller objective

- [ ] Every remediation Ready item passed before the one worker started.
- [ ] Only the exact owned implementation, focused test, fixture, and handoff paths changed.
- [ ] `P1.NEG.SCHEMA_VERSION` passes all required positive and negative semantics with the exact stable
      diagnostic, and all required checks and scope scans are recorded with exit codes.
- [ ] Independent review accepts the remediation candidate and its patch/manifest evidence against
      the quoted finding.
- [ ] The controller integrates the accepted candidate on top of the router packet commit and records
      the exact integration SHA and reciprocal provenance without modifying unrelated P1.S1 work.
- [ ] `P1.S2` remains blocked and no successor worker is launched.

After a verified handoff, the successor controller's only objective is to independently review and,
if accepted, integrate this schema-version remediation while preserving the rest of `da9625e78` and
keeping `P1.S2` blocked. Any later `P1.S2` authorization requires a separate router packet. This
controller packet claims neither complete Phase 1 nor production hosted behavior.
