# Project access boundaries

This document defines the provider-neutral access model used for managed
workers. It is separate from provider sandbox flags such as Codex
`workspace-write` or `danger-full-access`.

## Boundary enum

```ts
enum AccessBoundary {
  ReadOnly = "read_only",
  IsolatedWorkspaceWrite = "isolated_workspace_write",
  ProjectScopedControl = "project_scoped_control",
  DangerFullAccess = "danger_full_access",
}
```

## Semantics

- `ReadOnly`: can inspect scoped project state and run read-only diagnostics.
  It cannot write files, create jobs, start workers or push branches.
- `IsolatedWorkspaceWrite`: can write only inside its isolated workspace roots.
  It cannot write registry files, auth roots, `.git` internals, docker sockets
  or create child workers.
- `ProjectScopedControl`: can coordinate a project through brokered operations:
  create project jobs, create project worktrees, start/stop project workers,
  write review markers, integrate commits and push allowed branches. It should
  not receive unrestricted raw shell.
- `DangerFullAccess`: explicit escape hatch for full host access. Launch plans
  must require an explicit acknowledgement before enabling it.

## Enforcement model

The model is intentionally layered:

1. LLM proposes an action.
2. Runtime checks `AccessPolicyService`.
3. Broker executes structured project-control operations.
4. Sandbox enforces filesystem/tool/network limits.
5. Audit/events record decisions without secrets.

Do not rely on prompt instructions or command parsing as the primary safety
mechanism. Command validation is useful as a secondary deny list, but the
reliable boundary is brokered operations plus a sandbox that prevents raw
filesystem and tool escape.

Launch plans include a provider-neutral `CommandPolicy` for adapters that can
intercept tool or shell calls. The policy denies common escape paths such as
`git push`, `tmux`, Docker, SSH-style tools, inline interpreter execution like
`python -c` or `node -e`, direct shell script execution via `sh`/`bash`/`zsh`,
and direct references to scoped registry roots. This layer must fail closed
when an adapter advertises command validation support, but it is still only a
secondary guard. Ordinary safety must not depend on parsing arbitrary shell.

The Codex file-backend adapter enforces this policy at the `RunnerPort`
boundary before spawning provider processes. A denied command returns
`command_policy_denied:*` and the inner runner is not invoked. This makes
command policy an executable guard rather than documentation, while the
filesystem sandbox and broker remain the primary boundary.
Denied commands emit a `command_policy.denied` runtime event with the decision
reason and executable name only. Raw command arguments are not recorded.

## Edge cases covered by policy tests

- similar path prefixes, for example `/work/project` vs `/work/project-other`;
- `..` traversal through normalized absolute paths;
- symlink escape when a caller provides both requested path and real path;
- direct `.git` internals access;
- direct registry writes by non-broker operations;
- auth root and docker socket access;
- wrong job id, tmux, branch and remote prefixes;
- force pushes unless project scope explicitly allows them;
- launch fail-closed when an adapter cannot enforce the requested boundary.

## Provider sandbox mapping

Provider sandbox settings are still provider-specific low-level controls.
`AccessBoundary` is the higher-level runtime contract:

- `IsolatedWorkspaceWrite` may map to provider `workspace-write` when the
  adapter can enforce the workspace roots.
- `ProjectScopedControl` should expose project-control broker tools and disable
  unrestricted raw shell.
- `DangerFullAccess` may map to provider `danger-full-access`, but only through
  an explicit launch acknowledgement and audit trail.

Current Codex adapter status:

- legacy jobs without `accessBoundary` keep existing behavior except raw
  `providerSandboxMode: "danger-full-access"` is rejected. Full access must use
  `accessBoundary: "danger_full_access"` with explicit acknowledgement;
- `isolated_workspace_write` maps to Codex `workspace-write`. When a runtime
  command policy is present, Codex app-server command approval requests are
  reviewed by the runtime policy before the app-server receives approval.
  App-server turns also receive a strict `workspaceWrite` sandbox policy with
  the active workspace as the only writable root, network disabled and `/tmp` /
  `TMPDIR` excluded from writable roots;
- `isolated_workspace_write` workers are edit, test and handoff workers by
  default. If the workspace is a linked git worktree, Git may need to write
  common metadata outside the visible worktree, such as `.git/worktrees`,
  `.git/objects`, refs and logs. Do not widen the sandbox to the shared `.git`
  directory just to make `git add` or `git commit` work. The controller should
  integrate the worker output through Project Integration lifecycle tools. If a
  worker-local commit is required, use a commit-capable isolated clone where the
  `.git` directory is inside the writable workspace;
- Codex access-boundary jobs must set `networkAccess: "restricted"`.
  The adapter fails closed for implicit or explicit `disabled` network mode until
  a real OS/container egress sandbox exists;
- provider-side permission expansion and file-change approval requests are
  denied fail-closed. Project integration writes must use brokered integration
  tools instead;
- `danger_full_access` maps to Codex `danger-full-access` only when explicitly
  acknowledged;
- job manifests with an `accessBoundary` are validated before registry write.
  Unsupported or unenforceable boundaries fail closed instead of being stored;
- registry writes also check manifest consistency against `ProjectAccessScope`:
  workspace paths must be inside scoped roots, scoped accounts must match, and
  brokered project-control manifests must match project job/tmux prefixes.
  Existing workspace paths are checked with `realpath` so symlink escapes fail;
- `project_scoped_control` fails closed for ordinary Codex agent launches. A
  controller manifest can operate only through broker MCP tools such as
  `codex_goal_project_create_job`, `codex_goal_project_start`,
  `codex_goal_project_stop`, `codex_goal_project_mark_reviewed`,
  `codex_goal_project_create_worktree`, and the Project Integration lifecycle
  tools `codex_goal_project_open_integration_attempt`,
  `codex_goal_project_apply_worker_output`,
  `codex_goal_project_run_required_checks`,
  `codex_goal_project_commit_approved_changes`,
  `codex_goal_project_push_approved_commit`, and
  `codex_goal_project_reject_integration_attempt`.

A stored `project_scoped_control` manifest is not a live autonomous LLM process.
It does not think, loop, watch status, start children or call broker tools by
itself. It is the policy identity used by a host-side boss, daemon, MCP/CLI/SDK
surface or future restricted LLM launcher when those callers perform brokered
project-control operations.

Codex broker git/worktree operations use fixed structured requests and
`execFile("git", args)` with no shell interpolation. The broker validates
workspace roots, worktree roots, branches, remotes, force-push policy and
commit SHA shape before executing git. Push force mode uses `--force-with-lease`
and is denied unless project scope explicitly allows force push.

## Project controller recipe

For a long-running project coordinator, create a stored controller job with
`accessBoundary: "project_scoped_control"` and a tight `projectAccessScope`.
The controller is a policy anchor for broker calls, not an ordinary raw-shell
writer. It should coordinate child jobs only through project-control tools.

Do not describe the controller as "running" only because the manifest exists in
the registry. A live controller requires a separate execution surface:

- host boss thread, daemon, MCP, CLI or SDK calling broker tools with the
  controller job id;
- or a restricted LLM launcher that exposes only read-only status tools and
  `codex_goal_project_*` broker tools.

If that restricted LLM launcher is not available, keep orchestration in the host
boss/supervisor. Do not substitute `danger_full_access`; that creates an admin
worker, not a project-scoped controller.

`subscription-runtime-codex-goal tool codex_goal_project_controller_start` is
intentionally rejected by the CLI fallback because it creates a one-shot
in-process MCP server and exits immediately after the tool call. A live
controller must be started by a durable MCP/supervisor process that keeps the
provider runner attached for `status`, `stop` and `reconcile`.

Use `codex_goal_project_controller_launch_plan` as the preflight before any live
LLM-controller attempt. It loads the stored controller manifest, builds the
controlled-agent profile and returns either:

- `ok: true` with the exact broker/status tool allow-list and generated profile
  preview;
- or `ok: false` with fail-closed evidence such as
  `provider_cannot_disable_raw_shell`.

For Codex, the controlled-agent profile uses app-server native environment
disablement as the provider-level raw-shell boundary and keeps MCP/dynamic tools
available for the broker allow-list. Deny rules around `git`, `tmux`, shell
wrappers and Docker remain only a defense-in-depth layer. They do not by
themselves prove that raw shell has been removed from the LLM tool surface.

For Claude, the controlled-agent provider generates a strict MCP config and an
`allowedTools` list containing only `mcp__<server>__codex_goal_project_*` and
status tools. It also sends raw host tools such as Bash, Edit, Write, Read,
WebFetch, WebSearch and Task through `disallowedTools` as defense in depth. A
live Claude controller still requires a valid Claude session artifact and must
fail closed when that session cannot be provided.

The controlled-agent MCP lifecycle tools are:

- `codex_goal_project_controller_launch_plan`: build the fail-closed plan;
- `codex_goal_project_controller_start`: start a provider-specific
  controlled-agent only when the plan is ready and the provider can enforce
  broker-only tools. Codex requires `projectAccessScope.authRoot` to match the
  controller `authRootDir` plus a ready allowed account. Claude requires
  `providerKind: "claude"` and `sessionArtifactPath` inside
  `projectAccessScope.authRoot`. The stored controller `prompt.md` becomes the
  live controller objective. `maxGoalTurns` is available for bounded
  smoke/debug runs, not as the normal production orchestration mode;
- `codex_goal_project_controller_status`: read persisted controller session/run
  state and include provider liveness only when the provider instance is still
  attached in this MCP process;
- `codex_goal_project_controller_stop`: stop through the safe provider runner;
- `codex_goal_project_controller_reconcile`: reconcile provider liveness through
  the safe provider runner after crash/reboot.

`subscription-runtime-codex-goal controller-supervise` is the durable CLI owner
for a live controller session. It keeps the in-process MCP server and provider
runner alive, calls `codex_goal_project_controller_start`, polls status, and
stops the controlled provider on SIGINT/SIGTERM. The one-shot
`subscription-runtime-codex-goal tool codex_goal_project_controller_start`
remains fail-closed because it cannot own provider liveness after process exit.

If `start`, `stop` or `reconcile` return
`controlled_agent_provider_runner_not_connected`, the persisted state exists but
this MCP process does not own the live provider instance. That is not permission
to use `danger_full_access`. Use the owning process, restart from a clean
controller state, or keep orchestration in the host boss/supervisor.

Minimum safe scope:

- `registryRoot`: the single worker registry this controller may write through
  the broker;
- `authRoot`: the single provider auth/session root the host-side runtime may
  read to seed the controlled provider session. For Codex this is the
  `authRoot/account/auth.json` tree. For Claude this is the parent root that may
  contain the explicit `sessionArtifactPath`;
- `workspaceRoots`: existing project integration/checkpoint workspaces;
- `worktreeRoots`: parent directories where child worktrees may be created;
- `jobIdPrefixes`: project-specific prefixes for child job ids and job roots;
- `tmuxSessionPrefixes`: project-specific prefixes for child worker sessions;
- `allowedBranches`: branches the controller may integrate or push;
- `allowedGitRemotes`: usually `origin`;
- `allowedAccountIds`: optional account allow-list for child worker manifests.

The expected control loop is:

1. inspect status with read-only tools;
2. create or refill a child worker through `codex_goal_project_refill_worker`,
   or manually create a scoped worktree with
   `codex_goal_project_create_worktree`;
3. create a child job with `codex_goal_project_create_job` when not using the
   refill helper;
4. start it with `codex_goal_project_start` when not using the refill helper;
5. review the child diff and verification evidence;
6. write a review marker with `codex_goal_project_mark_reviewed`;
7. open the reviewed output with `codex_goal_project_open_integration_attempt`;
8. apply it with `codex_goal_project_apply_worker_output`;
9. run required checks with `codex_goal_project_run_required_checks`;
10. commit with `codex_goal_project_commit_approved_changes`;
11. push with `codex_goal_project_push_approved_commit` or reject with
    `codex_goal_project_reject_integration_attempt`.

Low-level git operations are not controller rights. Policy-controlled merge
rights must go through the Project Integration lifecycle in
`worker-core/integration`: open attempt, apply worker output, run required
checks, create a commit candidate, then push or reject.

The broker rejects child manifests that try to override the controller-owned
scope, request `danger_full_access`, request `project_scoped_control`, use
unapproved accounts, write job roots outside the registry base, or use
workspace paths outside the controller scope.
