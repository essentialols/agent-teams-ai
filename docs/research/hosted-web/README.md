# Hosted-web research evidence

This tree contains current and archived agent research. Preserve every existing artifact: do not
delete, move, rename, truncate, or overwrite files to make a newer conclusion look authoritative.

Start at `docs/hosted-web-phases/START_HERE.md`. Authority is explicit in the evidence catalog rather
than inferred from directory names:

- `canonical` is reviewed current authority;
- `raw` is immutable observed input;
- `generated` is a reproducible derivative;
- `historical` is retained context with no current authority;
- `rejected` is an explicitly declined candidate; and
- `superseded` is retained former authority with a named replacement.

Definitions, review dispositions, supersession, and retention are normative in
`docs/hosted-web-phases/EVIDENCE_LIFECYCLE.md`. The catalog schema is
`docs/hosted-web-phases/evidence-catalog.schema.json`, and the generator/validator live under
`scripts/hosted-web/orchestration/`.

New evidence must use a new exact path and stable evidence ID. Corrections link backward and forward
through the catalog; they never erase the bytes or review history they replace.
