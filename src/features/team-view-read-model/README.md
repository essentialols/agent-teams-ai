# Team View Read Model

Main-process feature slice for the desktop team read model.

It owns three stable IPC contracts:

- `team:getData`
- `team:getMessagesPage`
- `team:getMemberActivityMeta`

Public entrypoints:

- `contracts/index.ts` - browser-safe channel constants
- `main/index.ts` - feature composition and IPC registration

The use cases under `core/application` own worker preference, safe main-thread
fallback, live-message projection for notification scanning, missing-team
classification, and runtime enrichment. Electron, filesystem, worker-client, and
notification implementations stay in `main/` adapters and composition.

The existing HTTP team-data route is intentionally not routed through this
feature yet. It has compatibility-specific behavior for draft responses, runtime
state lookup, and notification side effects. Unifying the transports requires a
separate behavior migration with explicit IPC/HTTP conformance tests; this slice
preserves both current contracts.

Focused coverage lives under `test/features/team-view-read-model`, with preload
arity coverage in `test/preload/electronApiTeamViewReadModel.test.ts` and legacy
behavior characterization in `test/main/ipc/teams.test.ts`.
